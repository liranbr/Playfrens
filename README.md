## So what are we playing?
[Playfrens](https://playfrens.onrender.com/) helps you play with friends.  
Manage your games library to find, plan, and play together!

Playfrens is the only library manager where you and your friends can organize your shared interest in games, not just ownership,  
to easily answer questions like:  
* 'I'm sitting in a voice chat with two friends. What are all the games we wanted to play?'
* 'Which playthroughs can I continue right now? Which ones were paused, or abandoned?'
* 'Which games am I looking for more people to play with?'
* 'A friend is unavailable. What can we play without them?'
* 'I want to start a new game. Who else wanted to join it?'
